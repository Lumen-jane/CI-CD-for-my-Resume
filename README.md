# My Project
CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application
This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline setup for a Node.js application using Docker and GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates testing, building, and deploying the application to a staging environment.

Features
Automated Testing: Ensures that all code changes trigger an automated testing process.
Automated Deployment: Automatically deploys the application to a staging environment upon successful testing.
Project Structure
Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image for the Node.js application.
.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml: GitHub Actions workflow configuration for CI/CD.
package.json: Contains metadata and dependencies for the Node.js application.
server.js: Entry point of the Node.js application.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
Setup and Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
2. Install Dependencies
The project uses npm for dependency management. Run the following command to install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Running Tests Locally
You can run tests locally before pushing changes to ensure everything is working correctly:

bash
Copy code
npm test
4. Building the Docker Image
If you want to build the Docker image locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-node-app .
5. Pushing Changes to GitHub
To trigger the CI/CD pipeline, push your changes to the main branch:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
CI/CD Pipeline
Workflow Overview
The pipeline is defined in the .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml file and includes the following stages:

Automated Testing: Runs unit tests using npm test.
Build Docker Image: Builds the Docker image for the application.
Push Docker Image: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub with a staging tag.
Deploy to Staging: Deploys the Docker image to the staging environment. (Customize this step based on your staging setup.)
