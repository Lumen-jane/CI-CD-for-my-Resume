# My Project
CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application
This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline setup for a Node.js application using Docker and GitHub Actions. 

The pipeline automates testing, building, and deploying the application to a staging environment.

Project Structure:
Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image for the Node.js application.
.github/workflows/maryjane_pipeline.yml: GitHub Actions workflow configuration for CI/CD.
package.json: Contains metadata and dependencies for the Node.js application.
server.js: Entry point of the Node.js application.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

Setup and Installation:
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/Lumen-jane/CI-CD-for-my-Resume.git
cd CI-CD-for-my-Resume`

2. Install Dependencies
The project uses npm for dependency management. Run the following command to install dependencies:

`npm install`

4. Set up GitHub Secrets:
You need to integrate your own Docker Hub accounts with the CI/CD pipeline, this will allow automated building and pushing of Docker images as part of the deployment process.
In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions Add the following secrets:
DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username
DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password

5. Running Tests Locally
You can run tests locally before pushing changes to ensure everything is working correctly:
`npm test`

6. Building the Docker Image
If you want to build the Docker image locally, use the following command:
`docker build -t my-node-app .`

7. Pushing Changes to GitHub
To trigger the CI/CD pipeline, push your changes to the main branch:
`git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
`

CI/CD Pipeline
Workflow Overview
The pipeline is defined in the .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml file and includes the following stages:
Automated Testing: Runs unit tests using npm test.
Build Docker Image: Builds the Docker image for the application.
Push Docker Image: Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub with a staging tag.
Deploy to Staging: Deploys the Docker image to the staging environment. (Customize this step based on your staging setup.
